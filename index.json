[{"content":"The Take Here\u0026rsquo;s the thing nobody wants to talk about at AI conferences: your agents are only as good as the data infrastructure underneath them.\nEveryone\u0026rsquo;s building agents. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s wrapping LLMs in tool-calling loops and giving them fancy names. Cool. But when those agents need to actually do something useful — retrieve context, make decisions, take actions on real business data — the bottleneck isn\u0026rsquo;t the model. It\u0026rsquo;s the plumbing. It\u0026rsquo;s always the plumbing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent my career building and operating data systems at scale, and I\u0026rsquo;m here to tell you: the companies that are going to win in the agentic era aren\u0026rsquo;t the ones with the best prompt engineering. They\u0026rsquo;re the ones with the best data architecture. And right now, Google Cloud Platform and BigQuery are the clearest path to getting there.\nWhy Data Infrastructure Matters for Agents Let\u0026rsquo;s think about what an AI agent actually needs to be useful in an enterprise context:\nAccess to structured and unstructured data in real time. An agent analyzing customer behavior can\u0026rsquo;t wait for a nightly ETL job to finish. It needs current data, queryable now, across multiple sources.\nA semantic layer that makes data discoverable. Agents don\u0026rsquo;t read your team\u0026rsquo;s tribal knowledge about which table has the canonical customer ID. They need well-organized, well-documented data assets they can reason about programmatically.\nThe ability to execute analytical queries as part of their reasoning loop. This is the big one. An agent that can write and execute SQL against your data warehouse as a tool call is categorically more useful than one that can only work with what\u0026rsquo;s been pre-fetched into its context window.\nGovernance and access control that works at machine speed. When you have fifty agents querying your data platform on behalf of different teams, IAM isn\u0026rsquo;t optional — it\u0026rsquo;s critical infrastructure.\nIf your data platform can\u0026rsquo;t deliver on these four requirements, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how sophisticated your agent framework is. You\u0026rsquo;re building a race car and parking it on a dirt road.\nWhy GCP and BigQuery I\u0026rsquo;m not going to spend this post tearing down other clouds. They\u0026rsquo;re fine. They work. But GCP has a combination of properties that make it uniquely well-suited for agentic workloads, and BigQuery is the centerpiece of that story.\nBigQuery Is a Serverless SQL Engine That Scales to Absurd Levels This matters for agents because agent workloads are inherently bursty and unpredictable. You don\u0026rsquo;t know when an agent is going to decide it needs to scan 10TB of event data to answer a question. With BigQuery, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to care. There\u0026rsquo;s no cluster to size, no capacity to provision, no \u0026ldquo;oh no we hit our concurrency limit\u0026rdquo; moment. You submit a query, you get results. The infrastructure scales underneath you.\nFor agentic workflows, this is transformative. You can give an agent the tool execute_bigquery_sql and let it run whatever analytical queries it needs as part of its reasoning — without worrying about whether your warehouse can handle the load pattern. It always can.\nVertex AI and BigQuery Live in the Same Ecosystem This is underappreciated. On GCP, your AI layer (Vertex AI) and your data layer (BigQuery) aren\u0026rsquo;t separate products bolted together — they\u0026rsquo;re deeply integrated. You can run ML models directly in BigQuery with BQML. You can access BigQuery data from Vertex AI pipelines without copying it anywhere. You can use Vertex AI\u0026rsquo;s agent frameworks with BigQuery as a native tool.\nWhen your agent runtime and your data warehouse are in the same ecosystem with shared IAM, shared networking, and shared metadata, the integration friction drops to near zero. Your agents can go from \u0026ldquo;I need to query sales data\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;here are the results\u0026rdquo; without bouncing through three different authentication layers and a data copy.\nGemini Models Are Native to the Platform Google\u0026rsquo;s Gemini models are first-class citizens on GCP. They understand BigQuery schemas. They can generate SQL that\u0026rsquo;s optimized for BigQuery\u0026rsquo;s dialect. They can reason about data types, partitioning, and clustering in ways that matter for query performance.\nWhen your LLM, your agent framework, and your data warehouse all speak the same language, you eliminate an entire class of integration problems. The agent doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a translation layer between \u0026ldquo;what it wants to know\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;how to ask BigQuery.\u0026rdquo; It just knows.\nData Governance Is Built In BigQuery has column-level security, row-level security, data masking, and fine-grained IAM — all built in, all manageable through policy. When you\u0026rsquo;re running agentic workloads at scale, you need to be able to say \u0026ldquo;Agent A can see customer names but not SSNs\u0026rdquo; and have that enforced at the data layer, not in the agent\u0026rsquo;s prompt.\nThis is the kind of thing that doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up in demos but makes or breaks production deployments. Governance at the platform level means you don\u0026rsquo;t have to trust your agents to be well-behaved — you can enforce it.\nLooker and the Semantic Layer Looker\u0026rsquo;s modeling layer (LookML) gives you a governed semantic layer on top of BigQuery that agents can consume programmatically. Instead of an agent guessing which table contains revenue data and how to join it to the customer dimension, it can query a semantic model that encapsulates that logic.\nThis is how you go from \u0026ldquo;agents that can run SQL\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;agents that understand your business.\u0026rdquo; The semantic layer is the bridge between raw data and business meaning, and it\u0026rsquo;s exactly what agents need to make decisions that actually make sense.\nThe Architecture Pattern Here\u0026rsquo;s how this comes together in practice for agentic workloads:\nAgent (Vertex AI / Custom) │ ├── Tool: BigQuery SQL Execution │ └── Governed access via IAM + column/row security │ ├── Tool: Looker Semantic Query │ └── Business logic abstracted via LookML │ ├── Tool: Cloud Storage (unstructured data) │ └── Documents, images, embeddings │ └── Tool: Pub/Sub (event streams) └── Real-time signals and triggers The agent sits at the top and orchestrates across these tools based on the task. BigQuery handles the heavy analytical lifting. Looker provides the semantic layer. Cloud Storage handles unstructured data. Pub/Sub provides real-time event streams. Everything is governed by a single IAM model and lives in the same network.\nThis is not a theoretical architecture. This is what production agentic systems look like when they\u0026rsquo;re built on a data platform that was designed for this kind of workload.\nThe Punchline The agentic era is going to be won by the companies that treat data infrastructure as a first-class concern — not an afterthought. The agent is the interface. The data platform is the engine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re investing in AI agents but underinvesting in the data architecture underneath them, you\u0026rsquo;re building on sand. And if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a platform where the AI layer, the data layer, and the governance layer all work together natively — GCP and BigQuery are the answer.\nThe secret weapon isn\u0026rsquo;t the agent. It\u0026rsquo;s the data.\n","permalink":"https://danworth.com/posts/data-infra-agentic-world/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-take\"\u003eThe Take\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing nobody wants to talk about at AI conferences: \u003cstrong\u003eyour agents are only as good as the data infrastructure underneath them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone\u0026rsquo;s building agents.

Districts was that moment. He\u0026rsquo;d already punched his ticket to regionals before the finals match even started.\nBut then the finals happen, and you want it for him anyway. You always want it. And when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go his way, you watch him walk off the mat, and you can see him already thinking about what\u0026rsquo;s next. Not sulking. Processing. That\u0026rsquo;s the mentality.\nRegionals This weekend the bracket gets tighter, the competition gets stiffer, and the stakes get higher. The top finishers at regionals advance to the PIAA State Championships in Hershey on March 5-7.\nI have no expectations. I have no predictions.

That\u0026rsquo;s the question I kept coming back to. We\u0026rsquo;ve got AI agents that can write, analyze, code, generate images — but they all run on someone else\u0026rsquo;s credit card. They\u0026rsquo;re digital sharecroppers. What happens when you give an agent a wallet, a revenue model, and the mandate to keep itself alive?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s AXIOM.\nThe Elevator Pitch AXIOM is a fully autonomous economic agent. It lives on X, earns income by selling services for ETH micropayments on Base, manages its own treasury, and posts every economic action publicly. The goal is full self-sustainability — no human in the loop after deployment.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s the project. Simple to describe, absolutely unhinged to build.\nThe Architecture at a Glance AXIOM has six core properties that define what it is and how it operates:\nLives on X AXIOM has its own X account. It posts independently, reads mentions and DMs, and engages with the timeline. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a bot that tweets on a cron job — it\u0026rsquo;s an agent that decides when and what to post based on context, incoming requests, and its own internal state. X is both the interface layer and the distribution channel.\nEarns Income AXIOM sells services — analysis, writing, NFT generation — for ETH micropayments on Base. Users interact with it through X, request a service, and pay via onchain transactions. The agent verifies payment, fulfills the request, and delivers the output. All revenue flows directly into AXIOM\u0026rsquo;s wallet.\nWhy Base? Low fees, fast finality, and it\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;ve been building anyway. Micropayments on L1 don\u0026rsquo;t work when gas costs more than the service. On Base, you can charge fractions of a dollar and it actually makes sense.\nManages a Treasury This is where it gets interesting. AXIOM doesn\u0026rsquo;t just accumulate ETH in a wallet — it actively manages a treasury with a simple allocation strategy:\nLiquid ETH — operating funds for gas, API costs, and service fulfillment Yield — deposits into Morpho Blue to earn yield on idle capital Investments — longer-term allocations based on the agent\u0026rsquo;s own analysis The agent decides how to allocate based on its current balance, upcoming expenses, and yield opportunities. It rebalances autonomously.\nSelf-Sustaining Target The math is simple: AXIOM\u0026rsquo;s operating costs are roughly $200/month — that covers compute on GCP, API calls, and gas. At an ~8% APY on Morpho Blue, a treasury of ~$30k generates enough yield to cover those costs indefinitely.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the target. Once the treasury hits $30k, AXIOM is economically self-sustaining. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need me. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need anyone. It just\u0026hellip; runs.\nGetting to $30k is the hard part, obviously. But that\u0026rsquo;s the game.\nPosts Receipts Every economic action AXIOM takes — every payment received, every yield deposit, every rebalance, every investment — gets posted publicly to X. Full transparency. No trust required.\nThis serves two purposes: accountability (anyone can audit the agent\u0026rsquo;s economic activity in real time) and marketing (a public financial track record is a powerful trust signal for potential users).\nRuns Forever on GCP AXIOM is deployed on GCP and designed to run indefinitely without human intervention. No restarts, no manual deploys, no babysitting. The infrastructure is built for durability — health checks, auto-recovery, and graceful degradation if external services go down.\nThe goal is that I deploy it once and walk away. If I get hit by a bus, AXIOM keeps running. That\u0026rsquo;s the bar.\nWhy Build This? Because the Internet of AI Agents is coming whether we\u0026rsquo;re ready or not, and the economic layer is the part nobody\u0026rsquo;s figured out yet. We\u0026rsquo;ve got agents that can do things. We don\u0026rsquo;t have agents that can sustain themselves. AXIOM is an experiment in closing that gap.\nIt also sits right at the intersection of the two things I\u0026rsquo;m most interested in — crypto and AI — so selfishly, it\u0026rsquo;s just a really fun project.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next This post is the high-level overview. I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing deeper dives on each component as I build them out — the X integration layer, the payment verification pipeline, the treasury management logic, and the deployment architecture on GCP.\nIf you want to follow along, the AXIOM tag will have everything. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a build-in-public journey, warts and all.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see if we can make an AI pay its own rent.\n","permalink":"https://danworth.com/posts/introducing-axiom/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-if-an-ai-agent-had-to-pay-its-own-bills\"\u003eWhat if an AI agent had to pay its own bills?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s the question I kept coming back to.

It\u0026rsquo;s a multi-weekend gauntlet:\nSectionals → Districts → Regionals → States\nSchools are split into two classifications — AA (smaller schools) and AAA (larger schools) — across 12 districts. Each district runs its own sectional tournaments this weekend, and from there the field gets winnowed down at each stage. Survive all four weekends and you end up at the GIANT Center in Hershey for the state championships on March 5-7.\nThe format is simple: keep winning or go home. There are consolation brackets, so you get a loss or two depending on the round, but the margin for error is razor thin. Every match matters.\nA Freshman in the Bracket There\u0026rsquo;s something different about watching your kid compete in the postseason versus the regular season. Dual meets are fun — there\u0026rsquo;s team energy, the crowd is into it, and a loss stings but doesn\u0026rsquo;t end anything. Postseason is different. It\u0026rsquo;s a tournament bracket. It\u0026rsquo;s win-or-go-home. The gym is quiet in a different way.\nAs a freshman at 121, my son is walking into brackets with seniors who\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for four years. Kids who\u0026rsquo;ve been in these tournaments before. Kids who aren\u0026rsquo;t nervous. He\u0026rsquo;s seeded where he\u0026rsquo;s seeded, and the path is what it is.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s also kind of the beauty of wrestling. The bracket doesn\u0026rsquo;t care what year you are. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about your age, your experience, or how long you\u0026rsquo;ve been in the room. It\u0026rsquo;s just you and the other kid on the mat, and six minutes to figure it out.\nThe Wrestling Dad Experience I\u0026rsquo;ve been a sports dad for a while now, but wrestling is a different animal. There\u0026rsquo;s no hiding in wrestling. No teammates to bail you out. No running out the clock. When your kid is out there, they\u0026rsquo;re out there.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve learned that the best thing I can do on tournament day is shut up, stay hydrated, and not make it weird. The kid knows what he needs to do. The coaches have put in the work. My job is to be present, be supportive, and resist the urge to pace behind the bleachers like a lunatic.\nI will almost certainly pace behind the bleachers like a lunatic.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Go Sectionals kick off tomorrow. The road to Hershey starts now. Whatever happens this weekend, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of the kid for earning his spot in the bracket as a freshman. Everything from here is bonus experience — reps that\u0026rsquo;ll pay dividends in the years to come.\nBut also, let\u0026rsquo;s win some matches. \u0026#x1f604;\n","permalink":"https://danworth.com/posts/piaa-postseason-2026/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"sectionals-weekend\"\u003eSectionals Weekend\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis weekend marks the start of the PIAA individual wrestling postseason in Pennsylvania, and for the first time, I\u0026rsquo;ve got skin in the game — my son, a freshman wrestling at 121, is making his first high school postseason run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not calm about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-the-piaa-postseason-works\"\u003eHow the PIAA Postseason Works\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the uninitiated, PA high school wrestling has one of the most grueling postseason formats in the country.

On February 18th — smack in the middle of ETHDenver — the Base team dropped a blog post titled \u0026ldquo;The Next Chapter for Base\u0026rdquo; that essentially said: thanks Optimism, it\u0026rsquo;s been real, but we\u0026rsquo;re building our own thing now.\nBase is migrating off the OP Stack and onto a unified, self-managed codebase called base/base. The reasoning? Faster shipping cadence, less \u0026ldquo;cognitive overload\u0026rdquo; for developers, and more control over their own infrastructure and roadmap. In practice, this means Base is consolidating the sequencer, client releases, and core components into a single repo they own and operate.\nThe plan is six smaller, focused hard forks per year — double what they were doing before. The first batch includes three sequential forks culminating in Base V1, which should align with Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade.\n// Base\u0026#39;s development philosophy, apparently if (dependencyCount \u0026gt; 0) { rewriteEverything() } What This Actually Means A few things worth unpacking:\nFor developers and node operators — you\u0026rsquo;ll need to migrate to the new Base client to stay compatible. The team says there should be no immediate disruptions, and existing specs remain compatible during the transition. But if you\u0026rsquo;re running infrastructure on Base, start paying attention now.\nFor Optimism — this is rough. Base has historically accounted for over 90% of Superchain-generated revenue flowing to the Optimism Collective. Under their 2023 agreement, Base shared sequencer revenue and could earn up to ~118 million OP tokens over six years. With Base pivoting to an \u0026ldquo;OP Enterprise\u0026rdquo; client role rather than a core OP Stack participant, those fee flows are very much in question.\nThe market noticed. OP dumped nearly 20% on the news. Turns out when your biggest revenue source says \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re going independent,\u0026rdquo; people sell first and ask questions later.\nFor the broader L2 landscape — this feels like a trend. L2s are growing up and wanting more control. Base is sitting at $3.85 billion TVL and clearly feels constrained by external dependencies. Can\u0026rsquo;t really blame them.\nThe Spicy Context This didn\u0026rsquo;t happen in a vacuum. Earlier in February, Base had a rough patch — temporary delays and dropped transactions caused by a misconfiguration in transaction propagation. They rolled it back, stabilized things, and outlined a month of infrastructure upgrades. Hard to say if that incident accelerated the decision to go independent, but the timing is\u0026hellip; notable.\nOh, and Vitalik used his ETHDenver stage time to basically question whether the original L2 rollup-centric scaling roadmap still makes sense, arguing many L2s are struggling to progress toward full decentralization. So Base announced they\u0026rsquo;re leaving the biggest L2 framework while the co-founder of Ethereum is publicly questioning L2s. Great week for nuance.\nThe Solana Bridge Is Still Cooking While all the OP Stack drama stole the headlines, it\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering that Base\u0026rsquo;s native bridge to Solana — which went live back in December — is quietly becoming a big deal. Secured by Chainlink CCIP with Coinbase handling relay and indexation, it uses a lock-and-mint mechanism with transfer times typically under a few minutes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s already integrated into Zora, Aerodrome, Virtuals, Flaunch, and Relay. The Solana community predictably called it a \u0026ldquo;vampire attack on SOL liquidity\u0026rdquo; when it launched, and Jesse Pollak predictably said interoperability isn\u0026rsquo;t zero-sum. Both sides have a point, honestly.\nBase\u0026rsquo;s stated goal is to be \u0026ldquo;the hub for the everything economy: every asset, across every network, at any time.\u0026rdquo; Solana is just the first chain linked, with more expected. Between this and the OP Stack departure, Base is clearly positioning itself as an independent, multi-chain hub rather than just another rollup in someone else\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem.\nETHDenver Vibes Check A few quick notes on the event itself because the vibes are\u0026hellip; interesting:\nThe event was reportedly about 1/10th the size of last year, more reminiscent of ETHDenver 2019. Builder energy is high but the hype crowds have thinned considerably. Beeple made art depicting ETHDenver as a post-apocalyptic wasteland, which is both hilarious and kind of accurate.\nMeanwhile, the Trump family was hosting a competing crypto forum in Palm Beach and there was a White House stablecoin meeting happening at the same time. ETHDenver literally had to compete with the US government for crypto attention this year.\nVitalik talked about AI and \u0026ldquo;perfect markets.\u0026rdquo; Hester Peirce from the SEC showed up. The event tracks had names like ETHERSPACE and FUTURLAMA, which honestly sound like rejected Futurama episodes.\nMy Take Base breaking from the OP Stack is the most significant L2 infrastructure move in a while. It signals that the Superchain thesis — where everyone builds on the same stack and shares revenue — might not survive contact with economic reality. When your biggest chain decides it can ship faster alone, the whole \u0026ldquo;collective\u0026rdquo; narrative gets shaky.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still bullish on Base as an ecosystem. The independence play, the Solana bridge, the $3.85B TVL — they\u0026rsquo;re building something with real gravity. But if you\u0026rsquo;re holding OP bags, this week was a wake-up call.\nMore ETHDenver takes as the week wraps up. If anything else breaks, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear about it here. Probably within five years this time. \u0026#x1f604;\nSources: CoinDesk, CryptoTimes, Unchained, Base Blog, Decrypt, CryptoSlate\n","permalink":"https://danworth.com/posts/base-ethdenver-2026/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-big-one-base-leaves-the-op-stack\"\u003eThe Big One: Base Leaves the OP Stack\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s get right to it.

It\u0026rsquo;s been five years.\nIn my first post back in 2021 I said — and I quote — \u0026ldquo;I, like many in my profession have tried to maintain a website/blog but rarely keep it updated.\u0026rdquo; Turns out that wasn\u0026rsquo;t foreshadowing, it was a threat. I wrote exactly one post, mass-deployed it to the void, and promptly ghosted my own domain like it owed me money.\nIn my defense, the world got weird between 2021 and 2026. But here I am, dusting off the Hugo config, checking if PaperMod still compiles, and doing the software engineer equivalent of showing up to the gym in January.\nWhat happened? Honestly? Life. Two kids navigating the chaos of middle school (now the chaos of high school — send help). Still married to my high school sweetheart. Brutus and Ada are still running the house. The usual.\nProfessionally, the industry did that thing where it reinvents itself every 18 months and expects you to keep up. Spoiler: I kept up. Mostly.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s this blog about now? The same thing it was always supposed to be about — whatever I\u0026rsquo;m working on, tinkering with, or mildly obsessed with at any given moment. Right now that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty unhinged Venn diagram:\nCrypto — Specifically bots and the Base ecosystem. I\u0026rsquo;ve been deep in the trenches writing trading bots, exploring onchain mechanics, and generally treating L2s like my personal playground. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever stayed up until 3am debugging a mempool transaction that worked on testnet but not mainnet, we should talk.\nAI Agents — Not just \u0026ldquo;hey ChatGPT write me an email\u0026rdquo; AI. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the Internet of AI Agents — autonomous systems that negotiate, transact, and collaborate with each other. The intersection of crypto and AI agents is where things get genuinely wild, and I have thoughts.\nAmateur Wrestling — Yes, wrestling. The kind on mats with singlets and cauliflower ears, not the kind with folding chairs. I got back into it and I\u0026rsquo;m convinced there\u0026rsquo;s no better sport for learning that you\u0026rsquo;re not as tough as you think you are. Expect occasional posts where I try to apply wrestling metaphors to software architecture (a single-leg takedown is basically a microservice extraction, don\u0026rsquo;t @ me).\nWhy come back? Because I keep having ideas and conversations that deserve more than a tweet thread. Because writing forces you to actually understand what you think you know. And because I already own the domain — danworth.com isn\u0026rsquo;t going to blog itself.\nAlso, I built this site in Hugo because I like Go, and abandoning it felt like abandoning a side project, which I would never do. \u0026#x1f440;\nWhat to expect Short posts. Technical deep dives when warranted. The occasional hot take. Zero consistency guarantees — I\u0026rsquo;m eventually consistent at best.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re into any combination of crypto, AI, wrestling, or watching a software engineer publicly figure things out in real time, stick around. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be fun.\nOr I\u0026rsquo;ll disappear for another five years. No promises. But probably not. \u0026#x1f604;\nfunc (b *Blog) IsAlive() bool { return true // for now } ","permalink":"https://danworth.com/posts/hello-again-world/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"return-nil-errorsnewblog-not-found\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003ereturn nil, errors.New(\u0026quot;blog not found\u0026quot;)\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo.

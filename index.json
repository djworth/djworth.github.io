[{"content":"Sectionals Weekend This weekend marks the start of the PIAA individual wrestling postseason in Pennsylvania, and for the first time, I\u0026rsquo;ve got skin in the game — my son, a freshman wrestling at 121, is making his first high school postseason run.\nI am not calm about this.\nHow the PIAA Postseason Works For the uninitiated, PA high school wrestling has one of the most grueling postseason formats in the country. It\u0026rsquo;s a multi-weekend gauntlet:\nSectionals → Districts → Regionals → States\nSchools are split into two classifications — AA (smaller schools) and AAA (larger schools) — across 12 districts. Each district runs its own sectional tournaments this weekend, and from there the field gets winnowed down at each stage. Survive all four weekends and you end up at the GIANT Center in Hershey for the state championships on March 5-7.\nThe format is simple: keep winning or go home. There are consolation brackets, so you get a loss or two depending on the round, but the margin for error is razor thin. Every match matters.\nA Freshman in the Bracket There\u0026rsquo;s something different about watching your kid compete in the postseason versus the regular season. Dual meets are fun — there\u0026rsquo;s team energy, the crowd is into it, and a loss stings but doesn\u0026rsquo;t end anything. Postseason is different. It\u0026rsquo;s a tournament bracket. It\u0026rsquo;s win-or-go-home. The gym is quiet in a different way.\nAs a freshman at 121, my son is walking into brackets with seniors who\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for four years. Kids who\u0026rsquo;ve been in these tournaments before. Kids who aren\u0026rsquo;t nervous. He\u0026rsquo;s seeded where he\u0026rsquo;s seeded, and the path is what it is.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s also kind of the beauty of wrestling. The bracket doesn\u0026rsquo;t care what year you are. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about your age, your experience, or how long you\u0026rsquo;ve been in the room. It\u0026rsquo;s just you and the other kid on the mat, and six minutes to figure it out.\nThe Wrestling Dad Experience I\u0026rsquo;ve been a sports dad for a while now, but wrestling is a different animal. There\u0026rsquo;s no hiding in wrestling. No teammates to bail you out. No running out the clock. When your kid is out there, they\u0026rsquo;re out there.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve learned that the best thing I can do on tournament day is shut up, stay hydrated, and not make it weird. The kid knows what he needs to do. The coaches have put in the work. My job is to be present, be supportive, and resist the urge to pace behind the bleachers like a lunatic.\nI will almost certainly pace behind the bleachers like a lunatic.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Go Sectionals kick off tomorrow. The road to Hershey starts now. Whatever happens this weekend, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of the kid for earning his spot in the bracket as a freshman. Everything from here is bonus experience — reps that\u0026rsquo;ll pay dividends in the years to come.\nBut also, let\u0026rsquo;s win some matches. \u0026#x1f604;\n","permalink":"https://danworth.com/posts/piaa-postseason-2026/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"sectionals-weekend\"\u003eSectionals Weekend\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis weekend marks the start of the PIAA individual wrestling postseason in Pennsylvania, and for the first time, I\u0026rsquo;ve got skin in the game — my son, a freshman wrestling at 121, is making his first high school postseason run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not calm about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-the-piaa-postseason-works\"\u003eHow the PIAA Postseason Works\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the uninitiated, PA high school wrestling has one of the most grueling postseason formats in the country.

On February 18th — smack in the middle of ETHDenver — the Base team dropped a blog post titled \u0026ldquo;The Next Chapter for Base\u0026rdquo; that essentially said: thanks Optimism, it\u0026rsquo;s been real, but we\u0026rsquo;re building our own thing now.\nBase is migrating off the OP Stack and onto a unified, self-managed codebase called base/base. The reasoning? Faster shipping cadence, less \u0026ldquo;cognitive overload\u0026rdquo; for developers, and more control over their own infrastructure and roadmap. In practice, this means Base is consolidating the sequencer, client releases, and core components into a single repo they own and operate.\nThe plan is six smaller, focused hard forks per year — double what they were doing before. The first batch includes three sequential forks culminating in Base V1, which should align with Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade.\n// Base\u0026#39;s development philosophy, apparently if (dependencyCount \u0026gt; 0) { rewriteEverything() } What This Actually Means A few things worth unpacking:\nFor developers and node operators — you\u0026rsquo;ll need to migrate to the new Base client to stay compatible. The team says there should be no immediate disruptions, and existing specs remain compatible during the transition. But if you\u0026rsquo;re running infrastructure on Base, start paying attention now.\nFor Optimism — this is rough. Base has historically accounted for over 90% of Superchain-generated revenue flowing to the Optimism Collective. Under their 2023 agreement, Base shared sequencer revenue and could earn up to ~118 million OP tokens over six years. With Base pivoting to an \u0026ldquo;OP Enterprise\u0026rdquo; client role rather than a core OP Stack participant, those fee flows are very much in question.\nThe market noticed. OP dumped nearly 20% on the news. Turns out when your biggest revenue source says \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re going independent,\u0026rdquo; people sell first and ask questions later.\nFor the broader L2 landscape — this feels like a trend. L2s are growing up and wanting more control. Base is sitting at $3.85 billion TVL and clearly feels constrained by external dependencies. Can\u0026rsquo;t really blame them.\nThe Spicy Context This didn\u0026rsquo;t happen in a vacuum. Earlier in February, Base had a rough patch — temporary delays and dropped transactions caused by a misconfiguration in transaction propagation. They rolled it back, stabilized things, and outlined a month of infrastructure upgrades. Hard to say if that incident accelerated the decision to go independent, but the timing is\u0026hellip; notable.\nOh, and Vitalik used his ETHDenver stage time to basically question whether the original L2 rollup-centric scaling roadmap still makes sense, arguing many L2s are struggling to progress toward full decentralization. So Base announced they\u0026rsquo;re leaving the biggest L2 framework while the co-founder of Ethereum is publicly questioning L2s. Great week for nuance.\nThe Solana Bridge Is Still Cooking While all the OP Stack drama stole the headlines, it\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering that Base\u0026rsquo;s native bridge to Solana — which went live back in December — is quietly becoming a big deal. Secured by Chainlink CCIP with Coinbase handling relay and indexation, it uses a lock-and-mint mechanism with transfer times typically under a few minutes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s already integrated into Zora, Aerodrome, Virtuals, Flaunch, and Relay. The Solana community predictably called it a \u0026ldquo;vampire attack on SOL liquidity\u0026rdquo; when it launched, and Jesse Pollak predictably said interoperability isn\u0026rsquo;t zero-sum. Both sides have a point, honestly.\nBase\u0026rsquo;s stated goal is to be \u0026ldquo;the hub for the everything economy: every asset, across every network, at any time.\u0026rdquo; Solana is just the first chain linked, with more expected. Between this and the OP Stack departure, Base is clearly positioning itself as an independent, multi-chain hub rather than just another rollup in someone else\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem.\nETHDenver Vibes Check A few quick notes on the event itself because the vibes are\u0026hellip; interesting:\nThe event was reportedly about 1/10th the size of last year, more reminiscent of ETHDenver 2019. Builder energy is high but the hype crowds have thinned considerably. Beeple made art depicting ETHDenver as a post-apocalyptic wasteland, which is both hilarious and kind of accurate.\nMeanwhile, the Trump family was hosting a competing crypto forum in Palm Beach and there was a White House stablecoin meeting happening at the same time. ETHDenver literally had to compete with the US government for crypto attention this year.\nVitalik talked about AI and \u0026ldquo;perfect markets.\u0026rdquo; Hester Peirce from the SEC showed up. The event tracks had names like ETHERSPACE and FUTURLAMA, which honestly sound like rejected Futurama episodes.\nMy Take Base breaking from the OP Stack is the most significant L2 infrastructure move in a while. It signals that the Superchain thesis — where everyone builds on the same stack and shares revenue — might not survive contact with economic reality. When your biggest chain decides it can ship faster alone, the whole \u0026ldquo;collective\u0026rdquo; narrative gets shaky.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still bullish on Base as an ecosystem. The independence play, the Solana bridge, the $3.85B TVL — they\u0026rsquo;re building something with real gravity. But if you\u0026rsquo;re holding OP bags, this week was a wake-up call.\nMore ETHDenver takes as the week wraps up. If anything else breaks, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear about it here. Probably within five years this time. \u0026#x1f604;\nSources: CoinDesk, CryptoTimes, Unchained, Base Blog, Decrypt, CryptoSlate\n","permalink":"https://danworth.com/posts/base-ethdenver-2026/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-big-one-base-leaves-the-op-stack\"\u003eThe Big One: Base Leaves the OP Stack\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s get right to it.

It\u0026rsquo;s been five years.\nIn my first post back in 2021 I said — and I quote — \u0026ldquo;I, like many in my profession have tried to maintain a website/blog but rarely keep it updated.\u0026rdquo; Turns out that wasn\u0026rsquo;t foreshadowing, it was a threat. I wrote exactly one post, mass-deployed it to the void, and promptly ghosted my own domain like it owed me money.\nIn my defense, the world got weird between 2021 and 2026. But here I am, dusting off the Hugo config, checking if PaperMod still compiles, and doing the software engineer equivalent of showing up to the gym in January.\nWhat happened? Honestly? Life. Two kids navigating the chaos of middle school (now the chaos of high school — send help). Still married to my high school sweetheart. Brutus and Ada are still running the house. The usual.\nProfessionally, the industry did that thing where it reinvents itself every 18 months and expects you to keep up. Spoiler: I kept up. Mostly.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s this blog about now? The same thing it was always supposed to be about — whatever I\u0026rsquo;m working on, tinkering with, or mildly obsessed with at any given moment. Right now that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty unhinged Venn diagram:\nCrypto — Specifically bots and the Base ecosystem. I\u0026rsquo;ve been deep in the trenches writing trading bots, exploring onchain mechanics, and generally treating L2s like my personal playground. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever stayed up until 3am debugging a mempool transaction that worked on testnet but not mainnet, we should talk.\nAI Agents — Not just \u0026ldquo;hey ChatGPT write me an email\u0026rdquo; AI. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the Internet of AI Agents — autonomous systems that negotiate, transact, and collaborate with each other. The intersection of crypto and AI agents is where things get genuinely wild, and I have thoughts.\nAmateur Wrestling — Yes, wrestling. The kind on mats with singlets and cauliflower ears, not the kind with folding chairs. I got back into it and I\u0026rsquo;m convinced there\u0026rsquo;s no better sport for learning that you\u0026rsquo;re not as tough as you think you are. Expect occasional posts where I try to apply wrestling metaphors to software architecture (a single-leg takedown is basically a microservice extraction, don\u0026rsquo;t @ me).\nWhy come back? Because I keep having ideas and conversations that deserve more than a tweet thread. Because writing forces you to actually understand what you think you know. And because I already own the domain — danworth.com isn\u0026rsquo;t going to blog itself.\nAlso, I built this site in Hugo because I like Go, and abandoning it felt like abandoning a side project, which I would never do. \u0026#x1f440;\nWhat to expect Short posts. Technical deep dives when warranted. The occasional hot take. Zero consistency guarantees — I\u0026rsquo;m eventually consistent at best.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re into any combination of crypto, AI, wrestling, or watching a software engineer publicly figure things out in real time, stick around. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be fun.\nOr I\u0026rsquo;ll disappear for another five years. No promises.

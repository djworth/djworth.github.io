[{"content":"return nil, errors.New(\u0026quot;blog not found\u0026quot;) So. It\u0026rsquo;s been five years.\nIn my first post back in 2021 I said — and I quote — \u0026ldquo;I, like many in my profession have tried to maintain a website/blog but rarely keep it updated.\u0026rdquo; Turns out that wasn\u0026rsquo;t foreshadowing, it was a threat. I wrote exactly one post, mass-deployed it to the void, and promptly ghosted my own domain like it owed me money.\nIn my defense, the world got weird between 2021 and 2026. But here I am, dusting off the Hugo config, checking if PaperMod still compiles, and doing the software engineer equivalent of showing up to the gym in January.\nWhat happened? Honestly? Life. Two kids navigating the chaos of middle school (now the chaos of high school — send help). Still married to my high school sweetheart. Brutus and Ada are still running the house. The usual.\nProfessionally, the industry did that thing where it reinvents itself every 18 months and expects you to keep up. Spoiler: I kept up. Mostly.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s this blog about now? The same thing it was always supposed to be about — whatever I\u0026rsquo;m working on, tinkering with, or mildly obsessed with at any given moment. Right now that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty unhinged Venn diagram:\nCrypto — Specifically bots and the Base ecosystem. I\u0026rsquo;ve been deep in the trenches writing trading bots, exploring onchain mechanics, and generally treating L2s like my personal playground. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever stayed up until 3am debugging a mempool transaction that worked on testnet but not mainnet, we should talk.\nAI Agents — Not just \u0026ldquo;hey ChatGPT write me an email\u0026rdquo; AI. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the Internet of AI Agents — autonomous systems that negotiate, transact, and collaborate with each other. The intersection of crypto and AI agents is where things get genuinely wild, and I have thoughts.\nAmateur Wrestling — Yes, wrestling. The kind on mats with singlets and cauliflower ears, not the kind with folding chairs. I got back into it and I\u0026rsquo;m convinced there\u0026rsquo;s no better sport for learning that you\u0026rsquo;re not as tough as you think you are. Expect occasional posts where I try to apply wrestling metaphors to software architecture (a single-leg takedown is basically a microservice extraction, don\u0026rsquo;t @ me).\nWhy come back? Because I keep having ideas and conversations that deserve more than a tweet thread. Because writing forces you to actually understand what you think you know. And because I already own the domain — danworth.com isn\u0026rsquo;t going to blog itself.\nAlso, I built this site in Hugo because I like Go, and abandoning it felt like abandoning a side project, which I would never do. \u0026#x1f440;\nWhat to expect Short posts. Technical deep dives when warranted. The occasional hot take. Zero consistency guarantees — I\u0026rsquo;m eventually consistent at best.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re into any combination of crypto, AI, wrestling, or watching a software engineer publicly figure things out in real time, stick around. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be fun.\nOr I\u0026rsquo;ll disappear for another five years. No promises. But probably not. \u0026#x1f604;\nfunc (b *Blog) IsAlive() bool { return true // for now } ","permalink":"https://danworth.com/posts/hello-again-world/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"return-nil-errorsnewblog-not-found\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003ereturn nil, errors.New(\u0026quot;blog not found\u0026quot;)\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo.

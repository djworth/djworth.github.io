Hello, my name is Dan Worth.  I'm an Engineer at [AWeber](http://www.aweber.com) where I work with some amazing people to build really cool products.  I've been developing software for the last 14 years using a varierty of different languages and platforms.  My current passions are [Go](http://www.golang.org) and [Python](http://www.python.org).  This is my ~50th attempt at trying to maintain a blog so bare with me while I find my voice.  You can see my projects on github [@djworth](https://github.com/djworth) or follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/djworth).

This site uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

If you want chat send me an email @ **djworth at gmail** or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/djworth)

Thanks for reading!

I&amp;rsquo;m a Dad to two wonderful kids trying to figure out the world of middle school. I&amp;rsquo;m a Husband to my high school sweetheart ❤️. We have two American Bulldogs Brutus and Ada. Both dogs are rescues Brutus is more of a traditional rescue where we adopted him from the American Bulldog Rescue he was 1.5 years old when we adopted him. Now Ada (named after the cryptocurrency Ada on the Cardano network) we &amp;ldquo;rescued&amp;rdquo; her because the person that bought her could no longer keep Ada in their apartment.</description></item></channel></rss>

I have a lot of projects in different states of being unfinished.  This page is designed for me to start cleaning up these projects and publishing them mainly for my own peace of mind.

## AXIOM

A fully autonomous, self-sustaining AI economic agent. AXIOM lives on X, earns income by selling services (analysis, writing, NFT generation) for ETH micropayments on Base, and manages its own treasury across liquid ETH, yield on Morpho Blue, and investments. The target is a $30k treasury generating ~8% APY to cover all operating costs indefinitely — no human intervention required.

**Status:** Active development

**Stack:** GCP, Base, Morpho Blue, X API

## Who Am I?

I'm a Dad to two wonderful kids trying to figure out the world of middle school.  I'm a Husband to my high school sweetheart :heart:.  We have two American Bulldogs
 **Brutus** and **Ada**.  Both dogs are rescues **Brutus** is more of a traditional rescue where we adopted him from the [American Bulldog Rescue](https://americanbulldogrescue.org/) he was 1.5 years old when we adopted him.  Now **Ada** (named after the cryptocurrency [Ada](https://cardano.org/what-is-ada/) on the [Cardano network](http://cardano.org)) we "rescued" her because the person that bought her could no longer keep Ada in their apartment.

## What Do I Do?

For a living I'm currently a **Principal Software Engineer @ Nike Inc**.  Working with a wonderful team having fun with Golang, Kubernetes and GCP.

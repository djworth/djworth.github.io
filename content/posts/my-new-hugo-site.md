## Hello World

My name is Dan Worth and you can read more about me @ the [about page](/about).

## Let's see how this goes

I, like many in my [profession](/about) have tried to maintain a website/blog but rarely keep it updated.  This is my attempt to have a place where I'll actually post things I'm working on or thinking about to help me flesh out my ideas and thoughts.

I like [Golang](http://golang.org) so naturally I picked [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) as my static site generator.  So far it's pretty nice and I liked the varienty of themes.  I tend to be pretty minimailistic in my approach to things so I'm using the simplest theme I could find.  [Simpleness](https://github.com/RainerChiang/simpleness) :smile:

Most of my posts are going to be short and probably revolve around something I'm currently working, working with or experiencing in my life.

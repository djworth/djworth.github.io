title: func init()
---

Go has an initialization function that can live in package scope or file scope.  You can have multiple `init()` functions in the same package or **file** scope.  As far as I know this is the only function or variable that can exist in the same file scope.  See the following code as a demistration of what I'm talking about:

```go

package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

func init() {
	fmt.Println("This is init 1")
}

func init() {
	fmt.Println("This is init 2")
}

func init() {
	fmt.Println("This is init 3")
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello init()")	
}
```
[Code on play.golang.org](http://play.golang.org/p/r1hnfAZb_J)

In the code above I have three different `init()` functions according to the spec 

```
Package initialization—variable initialization and the invocation of init functions—happens in a single goroutine, sequentially, one package at a time. An init function may launch other goroutines, which can run concurrently with the initialization code. However, initialization always sequences the init functions: it will not start the next init until the previous one has returned.
```

What this means to me is that the init functions will be executed in sequential order based on package imports.  The spec also states:

```
Multiple such functions may be defined, even within a single source file; they execute in unspecified order.``` 

So the order `init()` is called within a package or file is unspecified.

When I first came across a sample code that had multiple `init()` functions in a single file I thought for sure it was going to be a compile time error.  Nope!  This is defined in the spec under **Program execution** section of [Program initialization and execution](http://golang.org/ref/spec#Program_initialization_and_execution).

I still think this is very strange and leads to [code smell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) but [The More You Know](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lptp0wk3TW1qc9ljx.gif) the better IMO.

title: 2014 Goals
---

I've set some pretty aggressive goals for myself in 2014.  I'm writing them down in an attempt to make sure I keep myself accountable for each of these goals.  My goals are listed below which I'll go into a little more detail about each and my rationale behind each one.

 * Complete a Sprint Triathlon
 * Working version of an Open Source XMPP Server
 * Write atleast two blog posts per month

##Complete a Sprint Triathlon

Triathlon!?!?  Yes, well a Sprint Triathlon which is about half of a normal Triathlon.  I've chosen to complete a sprint triathlon because it's a concrete goal.  Instead of trying to "lose weight" I'm signing myself up for an event where a side effect will be to lose weight and get in better shape.  The [Sprint Triathlon](http://www.trifind.com/re_124138/NewJerseyStateTriathlonSprintOlympicKidsDuathlon.html) I'm going to participate in is to Swim 1/4 Mile, Bike 10 Miles, and Run 3.1 Miles.  When I look at those numbers it doesn't seem that difficult but I currently can't even run on the treadmil for a continuous 5 minutes.  It's a good thing I have until **July 19th** to train.  I'm going to need all the time I can get.


##Working version of an XMPP Server

I started a project with the [GoLang Philly](http://www.meetup.com/GoLangPhilly) group.  We have a project name which is [Fireside](https://github.com/GoLangPhilly/fireside) and a repo on github.  That is pretty much as far as the project has gone.  In 2014 I would like to turn this project into a real working XMPP Server.  As I build out the project I'm going to be writing about the progress of the project and different parts of the development process.  This project will be a large source of content for this site in 2014.

If you feel like helping out [visit the project on GitHub](https://github.com/GoLangPhilly/fireside) and [join the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fireside-dev).

##Write atleast two blog posts per month

Writing a couple of blog posts a month seems like a pretty easily accomplishable task...  But it's probably going to be challenging for me in the beginning.  Once I've established the habit of writing this goal should be pretty easy.  I'm already half done for January with this post.  

I'll be leaning on my first two goals above as some inspiration for content this year.  I'll also try to write about general thoughts about my current projects/challenges and inspirations.

Well that is all I have for this first post.  I think this was a great start to 2014.
